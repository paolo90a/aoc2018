Advent of Code 2018:
Solutions in R and Python

Completed at 19:55, 5 January 2019

It was the first time I participated in Advent of Code and I have to say: it was an emotional rollercoaster. Naive as I was, after the first couple of days I thought it would be a little bit too easy to keep my interest. But then day 8 happened. This one really kept me up at night. I tried several approaches, hundreds of lines of code, manually created test inputs, but none of my solutions worked on the 'official' input and I just couldn't find out why not. After many brainbreaking hours of agony, suddenly the solution just popped into my head. I wrote about 15 lines of code in 5 minutes and it worked! This was the moment aoc really got me hooked. 

I tried solving every problem with just standard (and maybe pragmatic) R code. It was actually the first time in a couple of years using R, that I encountered problems which R is just not suitable for. Especially with larger strings or vectors, R is totally not efficient compared to other languages. Therefore a couple of solutions are written in Python. Using similar methods, Python was (in some cases) 1000 times faster than R. Obviously there were some tricks or packages I could use, but I also liked refreshing my Python-skills a bit. 

There was one problem I had no clue how to solve (day 22.2). Other people's solutions really opened my eyes for shortest-path-problems. Eventhough it was just a small variation to my own methods, it was a way of thinking I will really use for future problems (see my solution for more information). 

There were also a couple of problems where I PoC'd a solution but I didn't know for sure it was the one I should put time and effort in:
 <li> Day 9.2: I knew the brute force method would work, but I also checked the forum if there were other solutions. I learned about linked lists and double ended queues that day. However, I just worked out my own solution in Python.
